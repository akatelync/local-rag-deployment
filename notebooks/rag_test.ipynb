Another manifestation, Mr. President. Ito naman on a musical note, Mr. President.\\n\\nI was informed that this morning, the Senate officially adopted the singing and recital of the “Bagong Pilipinas” hymn and pledge in our flag ceremony. In light of this, I am reiterating my position that mandating all national government agencies and instrumentalities, including GOCCs and educational institutions, to sing and recite the “Bagong Pilipinas” hymn and pledge as lodged in Memorandum Circular No. 52 is invalid, Mr. President. Hindi na nga tayo kasali roon. Actually, nag-volunteer pa tayong sumama. Invalid na nga, hindi tayo covered, sumama pa tayo.\\n\\nRepublic Act No. 8491, also known as the Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines, includes in Article 36 thereof, the entire lyrics of our national anthem word-for-word. The same is true with the Pledge of Allegiance, which is also quoted in its entirety word-for-word in Section 25. Iyon iyong “Panunumpa sa Watawat”.\\n\\nThe clear intent of the legislature is that nothing is added to nor subtracted from what is sung or recited during the flag ceremony. The justification for the said Memorandum Circular is allegedly Section 19, which states that “The Office of the President upon the recommendation of the Institute shall issue rules and regulations for the proper conduct of the flag ceremony.” The issuance of rules and regulations, however, cannot mean that the Office of the President is given a carte blanche in the determination of what shall be sung or recited during the flag ceremony.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=2, end_char_idx=1602, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This is because the law itself has already mandated what should be sung and recited. Nowhere in RA 8491 is it provided that the Office of the Presidential shall have the authority to create or even add a new hymn and pledge, whose words and lyrics are not known from the public or not even debated on the Floor of the Senate or the Floor of the House of Representatives.\\n\\nSo, it is only through a law that amends RA 8491, that the singing and recital of the “Bagong Pilipinas” hymn and pledge could be mandated. If it is really the intention of this administration to mandate its singing and recital, then let them file a bill. A bill must first be filed, be submitted by the executive branch to amend the existing laws governing the national anthem, pledge, and flag-raising ceremonies. A mere memorandum circular is not sufficient.\\n\\nMy dear friends, ladies, and gentlemen, when we are forced to sing a hymn or force to recite a pledge, this already involves the way of thinking--our way of thinking--and the way of thinking of our people. If we do this every Monday, every flag ceremony, Mr. President, somehow we get influenced by what we are singing and what we are pledging to or about. Hence, such a mandate must emanate from the people's chosen representatives, like their legislators through a law. So, as lawmakers, it is crucial to uphold the rule of law and ensure that all mandates are in line with existing legislation while promoting national unity and national pride, it is a laudable goal, patriotism, love of country, gusto natin lahat iyan, it should not come at the expense of violating the law.

Additionally, we rationalized our fiscal incentive system, making them more performance-based, targeted, time-bound, and transparent.\\n\\nUnder the CREATE Law, the Fiscal Incentives Review Board and Investment Promotion Agencies or IPAs, which both play crucial roles in managing and promoting investment in the country, have approved a total of 1,119 applications from August 2021 to April 2024.

Let me share some figures from 2024 World Investment Report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. These numbers show us where we stand compared to our neighbors in Southeast Asia.\\n\\nWhen we compare the pre-pandemic years, from 2016 to 2019, with the post-pandemic years, from 2020 to 2023, we see a mixed picture across Southeast Asia. Most economies, including Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore have bounced back. Their foreign direct investment inflows have even exceeded pre-pandemic levels.

Ito ay magandang indikasyon na ang mga dayuhang mamumuhunan ay muling nagtitiwala sa ekonomiya ng isang bansa at handa nang magpasok muli ng kanilang pera.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this is not the case for Thailand and the Philippines. Our post-pandemic FDI inflows remain below pre-pandemic levels. For the Philippines, the post-pandemic FDI flow stands at US$7.7 billion or 16.7% lower than our pre-pandemic levels. Ibig sabihin, kahit naipasa natin ang CREATE Law na layon sanang pasiglahin ang mga pamumuhunan sa ating bansa sa gitna ng pandemya, hindi pa rin nakababalik ang ating FDI inflows sa dati nitong antas.\\n\\nTo better understand the gaps and challenges, we held consultative meetings with various Investment Promotion Agencies—including the Philippine Economic Zone Authority, Cavite Economic Zone, Clark Development Corporation, and the Board of Investments—and also with the various businesses that are officially registered with IPAs known as the Registered Business Enterprises (RBEs).

This has led to vagueness of the entitlement to tax incentives of RBEs. Dahil dito, maraming negosyo ang hindi sigurado kung paano nila maiaangkop at magagamit ang mga tax incentive na ipinangako ng CREATE Law.\\n\\n Major Concerns\\n\\nOne major concern is the entitlement of VAT zero-rating on local purchases. Under the CREATE Act, businesses are supposed to enjoy tax incentives like VAT zero-rating for purchases that are directly and exclusively used in their registered activities. However, the Bureau of Internal Revenue has given a strict interpretation of what “directly and exclusively” means. Bilang resulta, maraming negosyo ang nagbabayad ng 12% VAT na hindi naman bahagi sa orihinal na layunin ng batas. Ito ay nagreresulta sa pagtaas ng presyo ng mga produkto at serbisyo.\\n\\n Work-from-home Arrangements\\n\\nFurther, for businesses located in economic zones, under the current rules, RBEs under PEZA are prohibited from allowing work-from-home arrangements. Without risking their entitlement to tax incentives, this restriction leaves these businesses with little or no flexibility in how they manage their workforce.\\n\\n CREATE MORE Bill\\n\\nIn light of these challenges, the CREATE MORE bill is designed to further enhance the economic landscape of our country.

This proposed measure brings much-needed clarity to the application of VAT zero-rating on local purchases and VAT exemption on imported goods and services. Instead of the confusing term “directly and exclusively,” it introduces “directly attributable” to better define what qualifies for VAT exemptions. Simply put, VAT zero-rating and exemption will now apply to goods and services that are clearly linked to the registered project or activity. This includes essential services like janitorial, security, financial, consultancy, marketing, and even administrative functions such as human resource, legal, and accounting services.\\n\\nSa ganitong paraan, mas magiging malinaw at mas malawak ang saklaw ng mga produkto at serbisyo na sakop ng VAT zero-rating at VAT exemption.\\n\\nThe bill introduces a fixed 2% registered business enterprise local tax (RBELT) based on gross income to simplify the tax process for businesses.

I just do not know how it will be packaged and repackaged.\\n\\n Senator Gatchalian.\\n\\nMr. President, my initial thoughts on this will be the administration portion. How to execute it, taking into consideration the convenience and seamless experience of the tourist? We all travel and we all shop when we travel. A lot of us, including myself, actually avail of the VAT refund in different areas. And for me, one of the most convenient VAT refund experiences that I have encountered is in Singapore and also Korea. Actually, for that matter, once we buy, we give our passport, and all the merchandise that we bought will be sent to a database. And, when we go to the airport, show your passport or scan your passport. Everything will be there. All the merchandises that you bought will be there and the computation is so easy, and you can have an option of getting cash or getting credit card refund. But the point there is that everything is seamless and you do not have to worry about showing so many paperworks or showing so many receipts, Mr. President.\\n\\nSo, going by that experience, that is also the vision on how we will implement it here later on, if this law gets approved, and I just need to study carefully and consult with the BIR and the DOF on the administrative side. The concept is good and noble; it is just the administrative portion that we need to study very carefully.\\n\\n Senator Tolentino.\\n\\nThank you, Mr. President. I have no further questions.

One significant enhancement is the increase in the ceiling of incentives offered to investors, which includes longer durations for incentives and more deductions available to businesses. This adjustment is intended to make the investment environment more attractive, particularly in light of aggressive competition from other countries, such as Vietnam, which has been noted for its generous fiscal incentives and subsidies to attract foreign companies, especially in the semiconductor sector[^1].\n",

This enhancement aims to empower the government to act more dynamically in attracting investments, which is crucial as the global investment landscape continues to evolve[^2]. Despite these enhancements, it has been noted that the powers granted under the CREATE Law have not yet been utilized, indicating a need for a more proactive approach to leverage these capabilities effectively[^3].\n",
