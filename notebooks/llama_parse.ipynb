      "\n",
      "From that time on—actually, a little before that time—until the present, kung mapapansin ninyo wala nang masyadong nagte-text scam sa inyo ngayon ng mga, “nanalo kayo ng ganitong jackpot,” o kaya “iyong package ninyo ay kailangan ng i-redeem”—ganito, ganiyan. So, nangangahulugan lamang na malaki ang kinalaman nitong mga nag-o-operate na mga illegal na POGO sa ating bansa.\n",
      "7\n",
      "So, Mr. President, nagkandahirap tayong ipasa ang “Text Scam Law” na finally naipasa na, pero nagugulat tayo dahil tuloy-tuloy pa rin ang mga pagte-text ng mga scam sa atin. Iyon pala, siguro, mayroon correlation between those scammers and those that were raided just recently. So, the President's words, that legal and illegal POGOs are no longer allowed, somehow, made a big impact, at least when it comes to these scams that we are receiving…\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that is not to say that this will finally be over forever. There will probably still be other scammers that will try to fool our countrymen, but, at least, this is a large step forward. So, I think it will also be wise for us to have legislation to finally pass the banning--make it in writing, make it a law that no legal or illegal POGOs will be allowed and other online platforms that will be harmful to our countrymen. Wala na rin e-sabong, supposedly. So, hindi rin tayo masyadong nakatatanggap ng mga e-sabong text. Alam nating nangyayari iyan, pero, at least, nababawasan.\n",

We are also proposing that some of the buildings being used be used by the government, especially if they are not paying taxes.\n",

      "For the record, Mr. President, in a year’s time, the Department of Finance already mentioned that POGOs have yet to pay at least P50 billion in taxes.

      "I was informed that this morning, the Senate officially adopted the singing and recital of the “Bagong Pilipinas” hymn and pledge in our flag ceremony. In light of this, I am reiterating my position that mandating all national government agencies and instrumentalities, including GOCCs and educational institutions, to sing and recite the “Bagong Pilipinas” hymn and pledge as lodged in Memorandum Circular No. 52 is invalid, Mr. President. Hindi na nga tayo kasali roon. Actually, nag-volunteer pa tayong sumama. Invalid na nga, hindi tayo covered, sumama pa tayo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Republic Act No. 8491, also known as the Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines, includes in Article 36 thereof, the entire lyrics of our national anthem word-for-word. The same is true with the Pledge of Allegiance, which is also quoted in its entirety word-for-word in Section 25. Iyon iyong “Panunumpa sa Watawat”.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clear intent of the legislature is that nothing is added to nor subtracted from what is sung or recited during the flag ceremony. The justification for the said Memorandum Circular is allegedly Section 19, which states that “The Office of the President upon the recommendation of the Institute shall issue rules and regulations for the proper conduct of the flag ceremony.” The issuance of rules and regulations, however, cannot mean that the Office of the President is given a carte blanche in the determination of what shall be sung or recited during the flag ceremony.\n",
      "14\n",
      "flag ceremony. This is because the law itself has already mandated what should be sung and recited. Nowhere in RA 8491 is it provided that the Office of the Presidential shall have the authority to create or even add a new hymn and pledge, whose words and lyrics are not known from the public or not even debated on the Floor of the Senate or the Floor of the House of Representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, it is only through a law that amends RA 8491, that the singing and recital of the “Bagong Pilipinas” hymn and pledge could be mandated. If it is really the intention of this administration to mandate its singing and recital, then let them file a bill. A bill must first be filed, be submitted by the executive branch to amend the existing laws governing the national anthem, pledge, and flag-raising ceremonies. A mere memorandum circular is not sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear friends, ladies, and gentlemen, when we are forced to sing a hymn or force to recite a pledge, this already involves the way of thinking--our way of thinking--and the way of thinking of our people. If we do this every Monday, every flag ceremony, Mr. President, somehow we get influenced by what we are singing and what we are pledging to or about. Hence, such a mandate must emanate from the people's chosen representatives, like their legislators through a law. So, as lawmakers, it is crucial to uphold the rule of law and ensure that all mandates are in line with existing legislation while promoting national unity and national pride, it is a laudable goal, patriotism, love of country, gusto natin lahat iyan, it should not come at the expense of violating the law. Lalo na that we can do this in compliance with the law.\n",
      "15\n",
      "So, I urge, Mr. President, siguro the Senate’s legal counsel, please study this kung tama ang position ko. Please advise our Senate President. Exempted na nga tayo, hindi tayo covered, mandatory in nature ang circular, hindi tayo covered sa mandate, nagtaas tayo ng kamay na we volunteer to do something which is questionable, as per my understanding of the law, questionable under the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, that is my manifestation, Mr. President. I hope that Senate legal counsel siguro and the Senate Secretary can… Marami na akong mga niri-request sa best legal minds of the Senate, and I hope they address our concerns.\n",

      "Mr. President, esteemed colleagues, a pleasant day to you all. Today, I stand before you to sponsor Senate Bill No. 2762, otherwise known as the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises to Maximize Opportunities for Reinvigorating the Economy or CREATE MORE.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, we took a monumental step forward with the passage of the CREATE Law, or the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act, under the visionary leadership of Sen. Pia S. Cayetano.\n",
      "\n",
      "24\n",
      "26\n",
      "Her dedication to fostering economic growth paved the way for this transformative piece of legislation. This law was designed to address the urgent need for economic recovery amid the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. By lowering corporate income tax rates, we provided immediate relief to businesses struggling to stay afloat. Additionally, we rationalized our fiscal incentive system, making them more performance-based, targeted, time-bound, and transparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the CREATE Law, the Fiscal Incentives Review Board and Investment Promotion Agencies or IPAs, which both play crucial roles in managing and promoting investment in the country, have approved a total of 1,119 applications from August 2021 to April 2024. This approval represents P1.1 trillion pesos in committed investment capital and is estimated to generate over 130,000 jobs for Filipinos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ngunit sa kabila nito, G. Pangulo, lumalabas na marami pa rin tayong dapat gawin upang mas maging kaakit-akit ang Pilipinas sa mga mamumuhunan. Let me share some figures from 2024 World Investment Report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. These numbers show us where we stand compared to our neighbors in Southeast Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we compare the pre-pandemic years, from 2016 to 2019, with the post-pandemic years, from 2020 to 2023, we see a mixed picture across Southeast Asia. Most economies, including Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore have bounced back. Their foreign direct investment inflows have even exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Sa madaling salita, ang FDI flow ay tumutukoy\n",
      "27\n",
      "sa pagpasok ng pera mula sa mga dayuhang negosyante o kompanya sa isang bansa upang magtayo ng negosyo o mag-invest sa isang bansa. Kapag sinabi natin na ang FDI flow ay nakabalik na sa pre-pandemic level, ibig sabihin nito ay ang halaga ng mga pamumuhunan mula sa ibang bansa ay bumalik na sa antas na naitala bago dumating ang pandemya. Ito ay magandang indikasyon na ang mga dayuhang mamumuhunan ay muling nagtitiwala sa ekonomiya ng isang bansa at handa nang magpasok muli ng kanilang pera.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, this is not the case for Thailand and the Philippines. Our post-pandemic FDI inflows remain below pre-pandemic levels. For the Philippines, the post-pandemic FDI flow stands at US$7.7 billion or 16.7% lower than our pre-pandemic levels. Ibig sabihin, kahit naipasa natin ang CREATE Law na layon sanang pasiglahin ang mga pamumuhunan sa ating bansa sa gitna ng pandemya, hindi pa rin nakababalik ang ating FDI inflows sa dati nitong antas.\n",
      "\n",
      "To better understand the gaps and challenges, we held consultative meetings with various Investment Promotion Agencies—including the Philippine Economic Zone Authority, Cavite Economic Zone, Clark Development Corporation, and the Board of Investments—and also with the various businesses that are officially registered with IPAs known as the Registered Business Enterprises (RBEs). Through these dialogues, we gathered valuable insights and heard firsthand the sentiments and experiences of our stakeholders.\n",
      "28\n",
      "Three years after CREATE Law was passed\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors and industry groups have pointed out that there is a lack of clarity and consistency in the CREATE Law vis-a-vis its rules and regulations. This has led to vagueness of the entitlement to tax incentives of RBEs. Dahil dito, maraming negosyo ang hindi sigurado kung paano nila maiaangkop at magagamit ang mga tax incentive na ipinangako ng CREATE Law.\n",
      "\n",
      " Major Concerns\n",
      "\n",
      "One major concern is the entitlement of VAT zero-rating on local purchases. Under the CREATE Act, businesses are supposed to enjoy tax incentives like VAT zero-rating for purchases that are directly and exclusively used in their registered activities. However, the Bureau of Internal Revenue has given a strict interpretation of what “directly and exclusively” means. Bilang resulta, maraming negosyo ang nagbabayad ng 12% VAT na hindi naman bahagi sa orihinal na layunin ng batas. Ito ay nagreresulta sa pagtaas ng presyo ng mga produkto at serbisyo.\n",
      "\n",
      " Work-from-home Arrangements\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, for businesses located in economic zones, under the current rules, RBEs under PEZA are prohibited from allowing work-from-home arrangements. Without risking their entitlement to tax incentives, this restriction leaves these businesses with little or no flexibility in how they manage their workforce.\n",
      "\n",
      " CREATE MORE Bill\n",
      "\n",
      "In light of these challenges, the CREATE MORE bill is designed to further enhance the economic landscape of our country. Its primary goal is to not only return but also to surpass the pre-pandemic levels of foreign direct investments.\n",
      "29\n",
      "To achieve this, the bill focuses on three key areas. First, it aims to enhance tax incentives regime for registered business enterprises. Second, it seeks to clarify existing rules and policies on the grant of administration of fiscal incentives. Lastly, it strives to further promote an investment climate that will attract foreign direct investments in our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "This proposed measure seeks to amend the CREATE Act with several key provisions. This proposed measure brings much-needed clarity to the application of VAT zero-rating on local purchases and VAT exemption on imported goods and services. Instead of the confusing term “directly and exclusively,” it introduces “directly attributable” to better define what qualifies for VAT exemptions. Simply put, VAT zero-rating and exemption will now apply to goods and services that are clearly linked to the registered project or activity. This includes essential services like janitorial, security, financial, consultancy, marketing, and even administrative functions such as human resource, legal, and accounting services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa ganitong paraan, mas magiging malinaw at mas malawak ang saklaw ng mga produkto at serbisyo na sakop ng VAT zero-rating at VAT exemption.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bill introduces a fixed 2% registered business enterprise local tax (RBELT) based on gross income to simplify the tax process for businesses. Sa halip na magbayad ng iba’t ibang buwis sa bawat lokal na pamahalaan, ngayon ay iisang buwis na lang ang babayaran ng mga negosyo. Under the current law, different LGUs charge different local fees and taxes. This fixed tax rate aims to\n",
      "30\n",
      "level the playing field so all businesses, regardless of where they are located, are treated the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this juncture, Senate President Pro Tempore Estrada relinquished the Chair to Sen. Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, high value domestic enterprises with capital exceeding P20 billion will be eligible for new non-income tax incentives. This includes VAT zero-rating on local purchases, VAT exemption on importation, and duty exemption on importation and capital equipment, raw materials, spare parts, or accessories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kapag mas mababa ang gastos sa produksiyon dahil sa mga inisyatibong ito, maaari nilang ibenta sa ating mga kababayan ang kanilang mga produkto at serbisyo sa mas mababang presyo.\n",
      "\n",
      "This bill introduces substantial improvements in deductions, such as 100% additional deduction on power expenses. Mahalaga ang probisyong ito, lalo na at lumalabas sa December 2023 na datos ng Global Petrol Prices Database, pumapangalawa tayo sa mayroong pinakamataas na presyo ng kuryente sa Southeast Asia. Kapag mataas ang gastos sa kuryente, may panganib na ang mga industriyang malaki ang konsumo sa kuryente ay lumipat sa ibang bansa kung saan mas mababa ang kanilang gastos sa enerhiya.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, this proposed measure will grant 50% additional deduction for reinvestment in the tourism industry, and a 50% additional deduction on cost related to exhibitions, trade, or trade fairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important provision of this bill is the lengthening of the time period for availing investments. Habang pinahahaba ang panahon ng pag-avail ng mga insentibo, lalong nagiging kapaki-pakinabang ito sa mga negosyo.\n",
      "31\n",
      "CREATE MORE Bill\n",
      "\n",
      "CREATE MORE bill allows RBEs across all industries to implement work-from-home arrangements for up to 50% of their workforce. This flexibility helps businesses to adapt to modern work practices, improve employee satisfaction, and potentially reduce overhead cost related to office space. Bibigyang diin natin na ang ganitong probisyon ay para sa lahat ng industriya at hindi lamang limitado sa information technology and business process management industry o IT-BPM sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of flexibility in incentives, this measure will give IPAs more flexibility to determine which projects or activities should receive investment by allowing them to formulate their own Local Strategic Investment Priorities Plan. Sa ganitong paraan, natutugunan ang mga pangangailangan ng bawat IPA nang nakahanay at naaayon pa rin sa mga prayoridad ng gobyerno.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CREATE MORE bill also proposes transferring the authority to process VAT refunds from the BIR to the Department of Finance. This shift is crucial because it ensures that the agency handling the refunds is free from any conflict of interest--considering that the BIR is currently responsible for both collecting taxes and granting refunds. Sa ganitong paraan, maiiwasan na ang komplikadong proseso sa BIR. Madalas kasi ay sumusuko na ang mga kompanya sa haba ng proseso para lang maasikaso ang VAT refund sa BIR. Kalaunan, wala na silang magawa kundi magbayad ng lang ng VAT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, this bill introduces a new remedy for taxpayers. If a VAT refund claim is denied, taxpayers will now have the opportunity to file a request for reconsideration. Ibig sabihin, maaari silang magkaroon ng pagkakataon na\n",
      "32\n",
      "ayusin ang kanilang refund claim nang hindi agad kailangang dumaan sa\n",
      "\n",
      "magastos at matagal na proseso sa korte.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, the CREATE MORE bill is not just about giving incentives; it is about creating a ripple effect that uplifts our entire nation. Kapag ang mga negosyong nahihikayat natin na mamuhunan sa ating bansa ay yumabong, nagreresulta ito sa mas magandang kalidad ng buhay, mas abot-kayang halaga ng pamumuhay, at mas maayos na imprastruktura para sa lahat ng Pilipino.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa pamamagitan ng CREATE MORE, ang mga proyekto at aktibidad na may malaking pakinabang sa ating bansa—tulad ng food security-related activities, green ecosystems, health-related activities, at defense-related activities—ay nabibigyan ng suporta at insentibo. Kapag ang mga sektor na ito ay umunlad, tiyak na magbubunga ito ng mga positibong pagbabago sa ating mga komunidad. Mula sa pagbaba ng presyo ng mga produkto hanggang sa paglikha ng mas maraming trabaho para sa ating mga kababayan, makikita natin ang positibong epekto ng CREATE MORE sa ating pang-araw-araw na buhay.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this juncture, I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to the coauthor of this measure, Sen. Juan Miguel “Migz” Zubiri, for his invaluable contribution in drafting this significant piece of legislation. I also acknowledge the efforts made by stakeholders during the two public hearings, one technical working group meeting, and eight consultative meetings of the Committee on Ways and Means. As the chairperson of the committee, I deeply appreciate their dedication and inputs.\n",
      "33\n",
      "In summary\n",
      "\n",
      "The CREATE Law lays the foundation for tax and incentive reforms, the CREATE MORE bill aims to build on this foundation by offering enhanced and more targeted incentives to further drive investment and economic recovery in the Philippines.\n",

      "Mr. President, I stand here today to cosponsor a much awaited CREATE MORE Act. I cannot help but think back to 2018 when we passed the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act during the time of former Senate President Koko Pimentel. At that time, it seemed that the EODB, or the Ease of Doing Business Act, would kick-start a new period of booming investment in the country. And, indeed, in 2020, the Ease of Doing Business supported the World Bank. We climbed up an impressive 29 spots, from the 95th place out of 190 economies on the global ranking for Ease of Doing Business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things were looking up and then the pandemic happened— businesses scaled down or shut down, investments dried up, jobs disappeared, and the economy collapsed. And we, essentially, had to start all over again. And start over, we did, through the CREATE Act. We gave the business sector a big cut on corporate income tax to allow them to recover from the pandemic losses, keeping the businesses running and retaining their employees. But for all the\n",
      "39\n",
      "good that CREATE did—the first CREATE—it also created a few problems that we were not able to foresee at the time. But now, we have a chance to correct through the CREATE MORE Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some interviews, Mr. President, I even said that we made a mistake on the first CREATE, and I was being very honest about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foremost among these is the red tape that continues to hamper our business sector. To this day, despite the Ease of Doing Business Act, our bureaucracy remains a Byzantine maze that poses a challenge to foreign and local investors alike. What is the point of offering shiny incentive packages to draw investors in if we end up driving them away with our complicated bureaucracy anyways? That is why under the CREATE MORE Act, we are going to be streamlining our processes so that investors are not bouncing around from agency to agency and submitting redundant piles of requirements all towards an uncertain outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case in point, through the CREATE MORE, we are addressing a problem that has led to many of our existing locators considering leaving for other countries—that is the lack of action on their VAT refund applications. Malaking bagay po ito, Mr. President, because companies like Itochu—these are giant companies—Itochu is the owner of Dole Philippines. Pareho po tayong taga-Mindanao, Mr. President, and in our area of Mindanao, you know it is Dole and Del Monte that are thriving in these areas, employing tens of thousands of people. As a matter of fact, Dole has about 50,000 employees, half of which are in Bukidnon alone. They have been running into issues. For example, Itochu has\n",
      "40\n",
      "been running into issues with the Bureau of Internal Revenue because of the massive delays and denials on their VAT refunds, which is an incentive that is available to them as foreign investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Itochu, specifically, they have already lost P3.5 billion in VAT refunds since 2018. Let me repeat, P3.5 billion, and they have not received a single explanation for the delays and the denial. So, they fear that they will be unable to correct whatever BIR has found lacking in their documents, and that their future applications will likely go the same way, meaning, more money is lost in the pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, napakasimple lamang po nito. Noong wala pa iyong CREATE, noong wala pa itong regime na ito, iyong mga tax regime na ito, kapag ikaw po ay exporter ng pinya, katulad ng Dole at Del Monte, kapag in-export mo iyan sa ibang bansa papunta ng Japan, Korea, China, iyan ay dapat VAT-exempt, lalong-lalo na iyong mga kagamitan na ginagamit ninyo riyan katulad ng karton, ng mga crate, et cetera, dahil ine-export iyan, hindi ginagamit locally iyan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iyong value-added tax system is supposed to be a tax when you purchase goods in the localities in the Philippines. Ito, ine-export po ninyo. Ang ginawa po ng BIR, under a series of laws such as CREATE, and prior to CREATE, it was TRAIN, ang ginawa po nila ay VAT refundable na lang po, hindi siya VAT-exempt. Alam naman po natin, Mr. President, the BIR is never in the business of refunding money. It is always in the business of collecting, getting money. Income iyan kasi iyong VAT refund, they consider it as a revenue loss. Siyempre kasi sasabihin nila, “Ito iyong income natin ng buong taon.” Kung ire-refund mo iyan,\n",
      "41\n",
      "mababawas po ang kanilang revenue targets para sa taon na iyon. Kaya ang nangyayari po ngayon, ang Itochu, ang Dole, kapag nag-e-export po sila since 2017—I think nag-umpisa po ito 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 until 2023, pinapa-refund po nila iyong halos P3.5 billion. Ito po ay mga karton galing sa Davao.\n",
      "\n",
      "Davao will produce the cartoons. They bring it to the farms in Bukidnon and in General Santos. They are packed in these boxes and they are exported. Now, all those boxes have to be VAT refunded. Hindi na automatic na wala ng VAT. So, ang laki po ng nawawala nilang revenue dahil hindi nare-refund ng BIR ito. At kapag may problema pa, ang sabi po ng BIR sa kanila, “Take it to the Court of Tax Appeals,” na alam naman po natin, Mr. President, na aabot ng siyam-siyam iyong mga kasong iyon doon sa Court of Tax Appeals.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my point is, these are decades-old investors. Matagal na po iyan. Wala pa ako sa mundong ito ay nandiyan na ang Del Monte, nandiyan na ang Dole sa Mindanao. They have brought so much growth to our industries and they have created so many jobs for our people. Under Dole alone—I stand corrected—there are 42,000 Filipinos in their employ. If they decide to scale down, or worse, withdraw from the Philippines, then who will answer to those thousands of suddenly unemployed Filipinos? As well as matitiwangwang na po iyong mga lupa riyan. Alam naman po natin, prone na iyan sa squatting, prone na iyan sa away, land dispute. Gulo na naman po iyan. Alam po ng Presiding Officer iyan because he is from Mindanao.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, under this CREATE More, and I would like to thank the chairperson, Sen. Win Gatchalian, who took up the challenge to pursue this. We are going to\n",
      "42\n",
      "streamline the VAT refund process. We now have a clear set timeline for the application and appeal process. We also have limited documentary requirements to only those mandated by law and specified in revenue issuances. And to address the issue of unexplained denials, we have required the written communication of assessed deficiencies of refund claims including the legal and factual basis behind such denials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alam po ninyo, Mr. President, kung hindi natin aayusin ito—at alam ng ating sponsor iyan—what is going to happen is, they will just import boxes. So, the secondary industries na ang gumagawa ng paper, box, and crate, mawawalan na sila ng trabaho. Because it is easier to get bonded materials—iyong bonded, walang VAT iyan—i-import mo rito ang box, ilagay mo ang mga prutas sa loob, ilabas mo ulit, tax exempt iyon. Walang VAT iyon. Pero sino ang kawawa? Ang gumagawa ng karton, ang gumagawa ng crates, ang gumagawa po ng mga plastic na lalagyan ng mansanas o atis at kung ano-ano pang inilalagay doon sa loob ng boxes for export.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most importantly, we have assigned the Department of Finance to process and refund applications in place of the BIR, as the task of assessing VAT refunds may run counter, as I mentioned earlier, Mr. President. It will run counter to the revenue collection mandated by the BIR. We have revenue targets to hit after all, at ayaw po nilang ma-erode iyon. So, now we have a new system in place na ang DOF na ang magpa-process ng VAT refund applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BIR will still audit medium and high-risk claims but the power to grant the refund now rest with the Department of Finance which will establish a VAT\n",
      "43\n",
      "refund center within its revenue operations group that will handle electronic processing and grant of cash refunds of creditable input tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of the timeline, we are keeping a strict 90-day period for the DOF to release its decisions on the application. The taxpayer then has a window of 15 days to file a request for reconsideration and the DOF also has 15 days to act on this request. If the request is denied or if the request is granted but the BIR fails to act on a refund, then the taxpayer has 30 days to take up the case to the Court of Tax Appeals.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these clear timelines, we hope to put an end to VAT refund applications being unnecessarily dragged out, leaving our investors in limbo, wondering if they will ever see their money back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, noong pumunta po kami sa Japan, kasama ng malaking delegation—almost nine senators—we even had a chance to meet with Prime Minister Kishida. Iyan po ang bukambibig nila sa atin, ang pag-amend nitong VAT regulations na ito dahil ipit na ipit daw ang mga Japanese investors. Not only in Itochu—apparently, Mr. President, my dear colleagues, it was not only in Itochu, it was also the makers of ball bearings in Cebu—nakalimutan ko na ang isang grupo na iyan—and the other cheap manufacturers. Kasi they buy their packaging here in the Philippines. They were saying, if we are going to follow the rules now of the BIR, then we will just import all these packaging from China or wherever. Kawawa po. Maraming secondary industries na mamamatay dahil diyan sa problema na iyan.\n",
      "44\n",
      "I am very thankful that we are acting on this because when we went to Japan, iyan talaga ang bukambibig nila, when we will amend CREATE to be able to address this problem of VAT refund for many Japanese manufacturers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alam ba ninyo na nagpa-briefing po kami sa Economic Affairs Committee last week, 60% to 70% of our economies fueled by consumption. Ano po ang ibig sabihin niyan? Alam na alam ng ating chairperson kasi Senator Gatchalian was there in the meeting. Ang ibig sabihin niyan, 60% to 70% of OFW remittances ang ginagamit ng taumbayan para mabuhay ang ekonomiya natin—padala rito sa Pilipinas. Ginagamit po nila iyan. Pagdating sa bangko nila, magwi-withdraw sila, pupunta sila sa SM, pupunta sila sa Robinsons, mamimili ng mga kagamitan at pupunta sa restaurant. Can we imagine that? You know how much percentage is on manufacturing? Less than 20%. I think 16% on manufacturing and has been declining steadily. In other words, our exports on manufacturing is getting smaller and smaller.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does it mean? We have a high GDP growth rate—one of the highest in Asia. But if you ask me, it is artificial. It is a GDP growth rate. We are growing. But if you ask me, it is not long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "If something will happen in the world geopolitics--nagkagulo-gulo, hindi kaya magpadala ng OFWs ng remittances sa ating bansa--patay po tayong lahat. Patay. Even during the pandemic, what was keeping us alive was the padala ng mga OFW sa kanilang pamilya. But if we lose that advantage, we have no exports, very fatal. Tourism is also still growing. So, we have to make sure that we do not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.\n",
      "45\n",
      "So, we are clarifying the parameters of VAT exemption and VAT zero-rating. In the CREATE Act, VAT zero-rating was applied to purchases that are directly and exclusively used in the registered project or activity. This has always been a point of confusion among investors because there was no clear way to determine whether the input purchases were going to be creditable for VAT zero-rating. That decision was all up to the BIR. Siyempre, kung tatanungin mo iyong BIR, lahat iyan VATable. They get to decide what is directly used in the production process, and what is not. Incidental expenses on services like janitorial, security, and accounting services were excluded—never mind that these were completely necessary in keeping the businesses running.\n",
      "\n",
      "With CREATE MORE, we are now changing the language from directly and exclusively to directly attributable--meaning, registered export enterprises with high-value domestic market enterprises can now get VAT zero-rating on incidental expenses. Malaking bagay po iyan.\n",
      "\n",
      "CREATE More further allows high-value domestic market enterprises to avail of non-income tax-based incentives. They are entitled to VAT exemption on importation and VAT zero-rating on local purchases when their investment capital exceeds P20 billion, or their export sales in the immediately preceding year amounts at least $100 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past two years, the administration has been doing a fantastic job in selling the country as a rising investment hotspot in Southeast Asia. And when I was Senate President, I had the opportunity and honor to represent, together\n",
      "46\n",
      "with the President, in many of his business trips abroad. And it has been paying off, Mr. President. Marami ang nag-pledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to NEDA, during the economic briefing that they gave us last week, there was an 18.7% increase in pledges for net foreign direct investments between January to April 2023 and January to April of this year. But remember po iyong pledges, pangako iyon. Iyong pangako, pwedeng mapako. Kailangan talaga pumasok dito, nag-groundbreaking, at nag-ribbon cutting para naman bumwelo po ang ating manufacturing and exports in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if we ask many businessmen, Mr. President, they are still on a wait and see with this CREATE MORE. Wait and see pa rin sila kasi hindi pa nila alam kung ano talaga ang mangyayari sa kanila.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is still a considerable gap between pledges versus actual investments that have come in. But on the whole, there has been an increase, and we appear to be on the right track.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we do not want to just keep attracting new investors. We have to keep the existing investors who are already here, who have already poured billions into the country like Itochu and other manufacturing companies. Besides, what better way to attract new investors than to show them how happy our old investors are to be here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Siyempre, Mr. President, kung malungkot po iyong investors na nandirito na, sino ang papasok dito? Kasi lahat po sila ay representative of their foreign chambers. Magkukuwento sila na, “Huwag kayong pumasok dito. Malungkot dito.\n",
      "47\n",
      "Masama iyong tax regime.” Masama iyong bureaucracy sa ating bansa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matatakot po sila.\n",
      "\n",
      "If interested investors see giants like Dole, thinking of relocating else, then we have shot ourselves in the foot. We are not only losing long time investors, we are losing potential ones as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "And ultimately the biggest loser would be the Filipino people, because this will mean less opportunities for local suppliers, less interest in regional development, and less jobs overall.\n",
      "\n",

      "Mr. President, I thanked Senator Zubiri for introducing this representation to Dole Philippines. When he was our Senate President, he took a proactive role in making sure that our current investors are being treated well and their issues are being addressed. Tama po ang butihing Sen. Zubiri, kung iyong mga current investors natin ay hindi masaya, wala pong pupunta sa atin kahit anong incentives ang ibibigay natin.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Dole Philippines became our primary resource person. In fact, they were present in all of our meetings and in the seven recommendations that they gave this representation, we adopted six of them. The other one is the requested VAT exemption for importation. Baka hindi na po sila magtanim ng saging dito, mag-import na lamang ng saging. So, we did not accept that. But all the other six recommendations, we adopted it. One of which is what Senator Zubiri mentioned that as long as you are an exporter, you will enjoy VAT zero rating on all your purchases here in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you do not have to pay VAT on boxes, pay VAT on pallets—all of that, VAT zero rated na po siya—basta exporter po sila. Meaning, they bring out their products for their entire time for the rest of their exporting activity duration.\n",

      "So, I will start with the income tax rate. Is it my understanding that under the CREATE MORE Bill, the income tax rate will now be 20% for all domestic corporations? And to be clear, currently under the CREATE Law, it is 25% and only domestic corporations that have a net taxable income not exceeding P5 million and with total assets not exceeding P100 million that could avail of 20%.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, currently, it is a 25% and only this subgroup with those that meet those conditions avail of 20%. But the proposal now is that all the domestic corporations will only pay 20%, at least for domestic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. No, Mr. President. We retain the 20% for corporations not exceeding P5 million and then we also retained the 25% for corporations not exceeding P5 million. So that is a—\n",
      "51\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). So, that is not changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. No, that has not changed, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). So, what changed as far as domestic corporations are concerned?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. The only enhancement that we made, if you are a registered business enterprise under the enhanced deduction, you will now pay only 20%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). But it is an option? It is an option if you avail of the enhanced deduction?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, Mr. President. That is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). All right. So, I will repeat. So, basically, kapag ordinary corporation ka, hindi ka registered, kahit sinong mga nagtatayo ng negosyo, you are at 25%, that has not changed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, Mr. President. If your net taxable income is above P5 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). Yes, about 5 million, and not in your total assets do not exceed so you carve that out to avail of 20%. So, that does not change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. That is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). All right. The reason I ask is because during the CREATE debates, our now Secretary of Finance was already pushing for that 20% to be available to all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, I remember, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "50\n",
      "52\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). So, at that time, it seems like such a long time ago because the pandemic alters our perception of time, but we were at 30% and then the original CREATE Committee Report was 1% deduction only per year, if, Mr. President, recalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, I remember, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). But then at the last moment—and this is really how things work—our Secretary of Finance then felt very generous because, “Tapusin na natin ito, huwag na kayong makipagtalo sa 1000 amendments ninyo.” [Laughter]\n",

      "Naibigay iyong 5%, it went down from 30% to 25%. That is the history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, that is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). So, we were at 25%. Akala ko naman ngayon ay biglang bumaba na lahat sa 20%, hindi naman?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. No, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). So, generally, everybody will pay 25% except for this same group of people under the CREATE Law na iyon nga hanggang P5 million lamang ang total income and not exceeding P100 million, that does not change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. That is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). But, what is introduced is there are registered enterprises that may avail of enhanced deduction instead of iyong standard percentage na—\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. SCIT.\n",
      "53\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). —SCIT then sila rin puwedeng mag-avail ng 20%?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). So, I would say for the general population status quo?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, that is correct, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). All right. That is clear. I have no argument with that; I leave that—\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. And I remember, Mr. President, during that time, I was listening to the interpellation, the intention of Secretary Recto was to promote or assist MSMEs. That is why we introduced the 20% for corporations with net taxable income not exceeding 5%. So, a sort of progressivity in that sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). Yes. And if I may add, because this will help us whenever we revisit and, hopefully, we do not revisit too much, because I think it adds to the confusion. But I think it is our job to revisit if it will make business better for all, provide jobs. So, to add to the history here is that the data was shown and I do not know if my team has it readily available, so we can share it that we have one of the highest corporate income tax rate in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, that is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). And that is why even at 25%, we are still fairly high.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, Mr. President, that is correct.\n",
      "54\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). So, in as much as I am happy to show my support for the chairperson’s Committee Report on this point, wala bang move to make it even lower? Kasi nga I recall that we were still on the higher end. So, I will be now the Senator Recto, but I do not intend to be secretary of finance in three years; I am not trying to get your job, Secretary Recto. Wala bang move to lower this further?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Well, Mr. President, we studied the different corporate income taxes of Southeast Asia and will flash on the slide. We are almost at parity, or almost at equilibrium, compared with our other neighbors, except for Singapore, who charges 17% on SCIT, but the rest are almost the same, Thailand at 20%—we will flash it on the slide—\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). 25% nga tayo so, we are not the same. Because only a small—\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, 25% for large corporations, 20% for small MSMEs, Mr. President. So 20% for MSMEs, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). But may I ask, as the sponsor clarifies this further, iyong comparison natin with other countries, the chart I have is a little bit different--mas colorful iyong sa akin. [Laughter] Pero this kasi shows that four countries—Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos—are at 20. Is that what the sponsor has?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Well, we only looked at the major economies of Southeast Asia, Mr. President, but we will also take a look at that.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "53\n",
      "55\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Mr. President, since the majority of the corporations are considered small and medium, we are almost at equilibrium at 20%. So, the big corporations, those with above P5 million net taxable income, will be charged 25%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). Mr. President, I appreciate that the sponsor made a distinction between MSMEs and large corporations because that is really the whole picture, but our discussion is about bringing in foreign direct investments. So, for the purpose of this discussion, we are looking at the big corporations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). So, for the purpose of the big corporations, ang intindi ko sa data is mataas tayo because Thailand and Vietnam are at 20%, and tayo ay nasa 25% pa rin. Then, to add to the slide of the sponsor, kasi wala riyan, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos, are all offering 20%. So, that is competing with us because, tayo talaga, ang default natin is 25%. And then Indonesia, which has a huge economy and is also a competitor, is at 22%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. But, Mr. President, those who are going to apply as a registered business? Meaning, they can also enjoy other incentives—will also enjoy the 20%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). Yes, Mr. President. That is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. So, if they elect to be, enhanced deduction, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). That is correct naman, but it is not our default.\n",
      "56\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. It is not our default; we have to apply. If we are part of the SIPP, we apply for it, and then we can enjoy a suite of different incentives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). Does the sponsor know, or can the DOF tell us, what seems to be the choice, the preference, of foreign companies now, to avail of this enhanced deduction, wherein they can get 20% or the Special Corporate Income Tax (SCIT), which is iyong percentage ng sales nila? Kung tama iyong tanda ko, gusto nila iyong percentage kasi simple lamang, wala ng ipakikita pang maraming deductions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, that is correct, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). So, hindi rin sila pupunta rito sa 20%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. The lady senator is absolutely correct, Mr. President. The choice is the Special Corporate Income Tax because it is easy to compute. It is 5%—3% to national and 2% to local. And then, all we have to establish is the cost of sales. So, after that, we can already pay the 5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the FIRB, the choice of our exporter is to avail of SCIT because it is easy to compute, Mr. President. Once we establish the cost of sales and we have the gross income, everything is easy to compute already.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). Well, anyway, before I move on to my next point, if I recall correctly, Sen. Joel Villanueva and Sen. Risa Hontiveros were among the two; there may have been more, I hope I recall correctly. The two of them were pointing out that if miabababa sa 20% lahat or kung anumang maibababa, kunwari, ngayon ay 25% ang default natin, if I insist na gawing 20%, iyong savings na 5% ay magamit sana ng mga corporation para sa mga benefit package.\n",

      "among laborers. I think the two senators were quite consistent with their position on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think Senator Hontiveros is nodding, so I am correct. Senator Villanueva, I think, is in the back and probably not listening to me right now. [Laughter] But I think that was his position also.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, anyway, I am posing that there for the Body to consider because I may make it a formal proposal. Does the sponsor know off hand, ano iyong loss sa government if we make our default 20% for all corporations?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. We will get that number, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). And then if not, ano iyong 22?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. We will get that number, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). I just want Secretary Ralph Recto to be getting a taste of his medicine. These are the questions he asked me repeatedly and if I'm not mistaken, I think I record-- 9 times on the Floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Well, Mr. President, just to add to the discussion, the effective tax rate for enhanced deduction regime is 18%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). Sorry, can the good sponsor say that again?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. It is 18%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). No, the whole. I did not hear the whole statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. The effective tax rate?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). All right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. So, meaning when you when you use ED because you have deductibles—\n",
      "58\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). Oo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. And then when you minus all those deductibles and then use the corporate income tax, your effective tax rate is about 18.4%. For special corporate income tax, it is about 8.3%. So, in other words, if you apply for incentives and those incentives are applied to your businesses, your effective tax rate for enhanced reduction is only 18% versus those who are not registered businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "For special corporate income tax, it is about 8.3%, Mr. President. So, mababa siya because we have additional deductions along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). Correct. So, i-summarize na natin ito before we move on to a next topic; the general, the default, the default tax rate is 25% para sa lahat, hindi nagbabago iyon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). The CREATE More, same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). But under CREATE More, iyong 20%, puwedeng ngayon ma-avail ng both domestic and foreign corporations if they are registered enterprises, and they will particularly choose iyong enhanced deduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). But to be clear, sino and puwedeng maging registered enterprises? Kasi nga, kaya nga ang default natin is 25, hindi ka basta basta puwede.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Puwede.\n",
      "\n",
      "57\n",
      "59\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). Hindi naman ako puwedeng pumunta sa DOF o kung sa DTI, o kung saan mang investment IPA. I cannot go to any IPA and just say register me. You have to have qualifications, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). So, basically, hindi para sa lahat—\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). —para makuha iyon, hindi ba? It takes a certain status na ma-avail mo iyong sinasabi mong effectively 18% or 8%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes. We did not change, Mr. President, we did not change the qualification to apply to become a registered business. Under the CREATE law, you should be within the strategic investment priorities plan. So that remains intact. So, if I am a business and my business is inside the Strategic Investment Priorities Plan (SIPP), I can avail of the incentives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). You led me to my next question, Mr. President. I appreciate what you are saying, na hindi ninyo binago iyong general rule na kailangan kang pasok sa SIP, that is the Strategic Investment Priority Plan, bago ka maka-avail ng incentives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). Pero, Mr. President, ang napakalaking binago ninyo ay under CREATE, the SIPP is prepared by the national government--BOI or FIRB?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. BOI.\n",
      "60\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). BOI. Now, under CREATE More, you introduce this concept na may local SIPP at may national SIPP. Meaning, ang isang—and I do not, I am not so clear what local means. Does it mean, isang city, does it mean isang province, does it mean isang region? They can come up with their own strategic investment priority plan, which could be very different from their neighbor, which could be offering different…So sorry. So, my staff is clarifying that it is the IPA that will create.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must say and put on record that one of the main reasons for CREATE is that iba-iba na iyong mga offering ng mga IPA and even for investors, parang hindi na nila alam kung saan sila pupunta. And I thought one of the goals was to be like a one stop shop, and yet you will go to different IPAs in different regions and they will have different offerings. Now, we have actually legitimized that they will…Dati kasi, they are not officially allowed, I think, they are not really officially mandated to have their own. But now, we legitimized it. So, it is very confusing to me because I was made to believe that the source of confusion for many investors is these different treatments of IPAs and now we are legitimizing it. Pinapayagan natin. Sinabi natin na puwede sila ngayon magkaroon ng local SIPP. So, maybe the gentleman can help me understand this new concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. That is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, Mr. President, just as a background. The SIPP or, now, in this law, what we call as national SIPP, is created by the Board of Investments, and they usually consult with the IPAs. So, meaning, for example, what will form part of\n",
      "61\n",
      "The different tiers? What are the businesses that will create value for the nation?\n",
      "\n",
      "They came up with an SIPP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). That is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Those businesses who are within that SIPP can enjoy incentives. During the consultation, the IPAs made a very strong case of laying down that not all IPAs have the same strengths and weaknesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will give a very specific example: The IPAs that are located in the eastern seaboard, for example, CEZA, and APECO. These types of IPAs have very different strengths and very different weaknesses compared to their counterparts, let us say in Bataan, in Angeles, in Clark, or in Subic. They have very unique offerings there. For example: the agriculture, cold storage, and fisheries--these kinds of businesses. But, more often than not, these types of businesses are not part of the national SIPP because the national SIPP generalizes that all IPAs are the same regardless of their location and regardless of their geography. So, we tried to come up with a mechanism to harness the potential of that IPA because of its unique geographical location. So, that is the rationale why we created what we call a local SIPP.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, the local SIPP will not be a document that will be created out of thin air. It will be consulted with the BOI. It will also follow the same principles and standards of the national SIPP. So, it will be in line with the national SIPP in terms of standards and criteria. That is the whole rationale. Because there are a lot of cases where the national SIPP does not capture the local situation because it is created nationally--it is created here in Metro Manila.\n",
      "62\n",
      "That alienates the potential of particular IPAs. For example: In Zamboanga, they are also very strong there in halal products or products that they can export to Muslim countries. But that is not part of the national SIPP, Mr. President. The national SIPP cannot capture those local nuances. That is the reason why we included a local SIPP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). I understand, Mr. President, and I am not necessarily opposed to it. I understand the importance of our IPAs that are precisely trying to build the economies in far-flung areas or in rural areas, I recognize that. I think my concern now would be they have the authority to create their own SIPP. And, if I understand the way the bill is crafted, it is just with the guidance of BOI. So, I think we all know that that can be very tricky because--Well, that was precisely--I mean, I can share verbatim position papers, concerns of DOF. In fact, some of the people in DOF before are probably still there, on why this would not be an ideal situation. I understand that it should reflect the strengths of the local area. It should be able to make an offering that harnesses the talents of the regions--like the sponsor said, a good example, iyong halal food in the Mindanao areas. But if it is just with the guidance of BOI, baka para tayong maging chopsuey na chopsuey, Mr. President. Is that common in other countries na kaniya kaniya ang iba-ibang IPAs in other countries because I know that time and again one of our concerns is maayos na nagagawa sa ibang bansa, bakit sa atin hindi? So, may ganoon ba sa ibang bansa na given full authority ang IPA to come up with their own SIPPs.\n",
      "63\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Mr. President, what we are very strict on is the standards and criteria, that is why we did not change that in the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). You did not change that--the tiering system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. We did not. For example, in Section 300 of CREATE Strategic Investment Priorities Plan, the local SIPP will still follow the criteria set forth. For example, the priority projects or activities that are included in the Philippine Development plan, so dapat Philippine development plan pa rin siya or its equivalent or other government programs taking into the account the following. So, the standards are still the same, Mr. President. So, it is not going to be a—just left to the IPA to create. They still have to follow the national standards set forth in the law. So, that it will not be unwieldy, and it will not be without any rhyme or reason. So, we want to make sure that we give them flexibility in capturing their local strengths and their local nuances, but at the same time, following as the standards set by the law, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Cayetano (P). This point I will have to defer and discuss further with the gentlemen. But before I do that, I will put this on record so that your team can also understand where my concern is coming from. I wish I had visual so everyone can understand. I do not know. But just to be clear, the way CREATE law was crafted and as the gentleman is saying it is the same, hindi naman binago. May Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. So, the more incentives, more incentives are given to Tier 3. Tama ba?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, Mr. President.\n",

So, we really want to incentivize that because again, if we look back at history, there is a natural direction that countries follow when they start. Let us say they start with farming, then they start with very basic processing--very basic--iyong literally na farm products mo ilalagay mo sa bote. Napaka-basic. Pero after than, iyong products na iyon namo-modify iyan using science and technology and so on and so forth. So, nagiging more high value. So, the more highly valued, that is what we want. That is precisely why we are trying to give more incentives talaga to these higher values.\n",

So a lot of these women who were able to bring their kids to send their kids to college work in the market, work as laborers in a factory sewing--talagang very basic. Hindi nila kailangan na nakapag-aral sila, pero through their hard work naangat nila iyong kabuhayan ng family.

That is why, in the first CREATE, FIRB was reborn. It was an old office, and it was reborn and added a lot of powers in order to instill discipline among IPAs. That concept remains the same.

So, kung sasabihin nating ang tinax (tax) ng Pilipinas is USD1 billion worth of goods at ang lumabas ng China USD1.8 or USD2 billion, iyon iyong statistics. Nagbabago minsan pero hindi natin ma-solve. So, kung sasabihin nating iyong VAT mataas na tayo, 12%, kasi, actually, iong ibang bansa, itinataas na nila iyong VAT ngayon, pero sila naman, katulad ng Singapore, nata-tax nila lahat. At walang nagrereklamo na hinihingan sila, whether Customs iyon, VAT, or income tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "My last point naman is, I really get iyong examples ni Senator Gatchalian, but if he can forgive me total mas matanda ako sa kaniya in age at mas matanda rin naman ako sa kaniya sa politika—since 1992 pa ako nag-konsehal, then 1998 naging congressman—nag-umpisa kasi iyan na maganda ang intensyon, na iyong mga sulok-sulok ng Pilipinas or hindi highly urbanized, magkaroon ng incentives. EPZA pa noon, tapos naging PEZA. And then, siyempre, ang nangyari kung mas malakas ang boses mo dahil may senador ka, may secretary ka, may Senate President ka, o may Speaker ka, nag-create din ng economic zone sa lugar nila. So, lumaki ngayon iyong incentives doon sa mga lugar na iyon, iyong iba nating binanggit.\n",

      "There are no easy answers. While the gentleman was talking, ni-Google ko lang—iyong halal industry is now USD2 trillion, and it is estimated that in a few months or in a year or so, aabot ng USD2.8 trillion. Hindi lang ito pagkain; pati iyong mga makeup and everything. So, ano ang point ko roon, Mr. President? Ang point ko, hindi dapat local na ang sumipsip or mag-SIPP.

      "Senator Gatchalian. No, Mr. President. No need for suspension. I just want to get the exact wording on where we will be getting the initial refund.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, in the National Internal Revenue Code, Section 106 of the Tax Code, requires that 5% of the total VAT collection of the BIR and the BOC from the immediately preceding year shall be automatically appropriated annually and shall be treated as a special account in the General Fund or a trust receipt for the purpose of funding claims for VAT refund.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, Mr. President, it will be from the general fund, but a 5% of the tax of the total VAT collection will be allocated to that fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Tolentino. Mr. President, I understand, glancing at the proposed measure, there is a Section 1(D). The amount not necessary for the VAT refund under this Act shall be charged against the special account in the general fund. Is this the same?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, Mr. President. It is the same, 106. That is why I wanted to get the exact provision in the tax code. So, it will be provided under Section 106. And, Section 106 requires that 5% of the total VAT collection be automatically appropriated in a special account in the general fund.\n",
      "89\n",
      "Senator Tolentino. So, may we just get a short answer? Is there a difference between the special fund and the special account? Special account is mentioned in the proposed measure, while—if I am not mistaken—special fund refers to another item. Is that the same or just a matter of semantics here, Mr. President?\n",
      "\n",

      "Senator Gatchalian. The intention is the same, Mr. President, special account in the general fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Tolentino. So, Mr. President, the next question coming from this representation is that, will this fund be enough to cover the additional burden relative to the funds mentioned a while ago? Because I have here a—I was supposed to have this shown on the screen—a chart of the funds, which I believe is still pending VAT refund claims. This is relative to the TRAIN Law for the quarter ending June 2024. So, there is supposed to be 94 claims, ongoing verification for claims, for review, totaling—totaling, for the BOC alone, the Bureau of Customs—P644 million but for the BIR, it is P3.296 billion … it is more, trillion. So, Mr. President, papaano po ito? Marami pang refund claims tapos dito rin ba ito kukunin sa account na ito? Is that correct?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, Mr. President, because the nature of the refund is the same—it is for VAT. So, just to flash on the screen Slide 44, for 2023 there is a P23 billion allocated in this special account in the general fund.\n",
      "90\n",
      "So, for just for 2023, about P23 billion. The total refund that happened in 2023—P7.96 billion. And for this particular law, it is estimated that the refund is about P2 to P4 billion, Mr. President, thereabouts. So, we have more than ample money to execute this proposed measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Tolentino. So, Mr. President, even though it would impose an additional burden on the special fund there would be sufficient fund to cover all of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, Mr. President, because the 5% is hinged on the total VAT collection so there will be sufficient funds every year for VAT refunds, in other words. And, if we look at the 2023 numbers, 15 billion remains to be unutilized for VAT refunds. So, an additional P2 to P4 billion will not be a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Tolentino. Thank you, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "On another matter, in the original bill, the total amount of VAT refund granted to tourist shall not exceed 85% of the total amount of the VAT paid by the tourists, tama po ba ito?\n",

      "Senator Gatchalian. Mr. President, the committee report version does not include that anymore.\n",

      "Senator Tolentino. May we know the reason why this was deleted? Although, I think I signed the committee report likewise.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      " Sen. Gatchalian.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, Mr. President, the product you bought should be taken out of the country because it is considered exports. Once you opened it here in the Philippines, then it is not eligible anymore for VAT refund because, in effect, you consumed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now if you want to return it, then you can return it to the store, or if you want to exchange it, you can exchange it with the store but the concept here, that item needs to leave the country. So, in other jurisdictions, sometimes they inspect it randomly. If they see that the items are already used then you are not eligible for VAT refund. But if the items are completely brand new and you take it out of the country, then you are eligible for VAT refund.\n",
      "\n",
      " Senator Tolentino.\n",
      "\n",
      "All right, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about the aspect in other jurisdictions, Mr. President? The aspect of abuse, for instance.\n",

      "90\n",
      "92\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Tolentino. Although this is not too farfetched, a nonresident would be purchasing a good, an item, but then again it would be transferred to a local resident, ang nakinabang po ay local. So, papaano po iyon, Mr. President? Is there a mechanism to determine this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Mr. President, there are stories that we came across regarding fraud and circumventing the rules of VAT refund or gaming the system, in other words. For example, in Singapore, there is a story that some individual bought jewelries and sold it to the local market or there is a collusion that happened between a buyer and the seller.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also took note of a story in Japan where in the Japanese immediately, at point of sale, refunds you the 12% but, obviously, when that happens, some of the tourist interns sold it to the local market.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the most important aspect here, Mr. President, is digitalization. That is why in the bill, we included a clause here that “Government should engage services of one or more reputable internationally recognized VAT refund operators that shall provide end-to-end solutions. So, everything is digitalized. Meaning, when you buy the product, they will scan your passport and when you exit the airport, your name is already there, the items that you bought is already there, and customs will have full view of the items that you bought within their jurisdiction.

      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Well, in practice, Mr. President, they normally take it out from the tourist, so there is a service fee that they will deduct from the VAT payments.\n",

      "\n",
      "Senator Tolentino. So, I am now clarified, Mr. President. Ang tanong ko na lamang po ngayon siguro is the tail end of my question is that, this is really a good measure to promote tourism, but how can we, likewise, help the Local Government Units, for instance? Posible ba na doon sa ire-refund ay magkaroon ng bahagyang porsiyento ang mga pamahalaang lokal kung saan nagmula iyong produkto at saan namili?\n",
      "\n",
      "I know for a fact na talagang pupunta ito, this will be siphoned by the entire VAT mechanism and redistributed to LGUs through their formerly known IRA and ngayon NTA. So, is there a possibility when we go into the period of amendments, perhaps, a certain percentage will go to the host LGU or municipality who encouraged the setting up of plants or manufacturing firms, and engaged the creativity and innovation of the local population in producing a certain product. Kaya nabili iyon, in-encourage ng LGU, puwede bang ma-retain\n",
      "94\n",
      "iyong halimbawa kung 8.5%, iyong 0.5% maiwan na lamang doon sa LGU na nanghikayat na magkaroon ng ganitong natatanging produkto na binili ng turista.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can there be a mechanism that would really enhance not just tourism but encourage all LGUs, supportive of local products? We have One Town, One Product Law, Mr. President. So, that they can be more engaged and more supportive in various income-generating endeavors within their localities. Can this be done through this measure?\n",
      "\n",
      " Senator Gatchalian\n",
      "\n",
      "I see the good intention of the gentleman from Tagaytay that to encourage participation from the local government, encourage manufacturers from a particular jurisdiction, to participate in this VAT refund concept. That is also one of the reasons why we lowered down the value of goods purchased per transaction to P3,000 so that we encourage small stores medium-sized stores to be accredited and be part of this VAT refund mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to a certain portion going to the local government, because it is a refund, so we are giving the money to the tourist and I do not know how to have some form of a flow back to because we are giving it; we are paying the tourist. So, the money is outflow, but I am not very sure on how to channel some portion of it to the local government. So, loosely, if the refund is 100%, maybe a portion going to the local government, I think that is—\n",
      "\n",
      " Senator Tolentino\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright. That is my intention, Mr. President, to really encourage by not just totally refunding the amount under this measure, but a portion would be earmarked to serve as an encouragement. Let me give a concrete example: the Marikina shoe industry has been dying, being\n",
      "95\n",
      "resuscitated, dying again, so to help the Marikina shoe industry, instead of just giving a 100% full VAT refund, why not withhold a certain amount to be given to the Marikina City government, thereafter, to be transferred to the Marikina shoe manufacturers association, if there is one, or to have a fund within the local government of Marikina to encourage our shoemakers in Marikina? The same is true with our textile manufacturers in South Cotabato—iyon pong gumagawa ng mga magagandang tela—para ma-encourage sila. Hindi po iyong na-refund ng buong-buo roon sa mga turista na namili, at kaya naman sila nakabili ay dahil ang laki ng tulong at suporta ng ating mga local government unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a possibility to have a window of an amendment that would encourage the local government units to really participate in a mechanism like this that would boost tourism and, at the same time, generate income for the local government units?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. I am thinking loosely, Mr. President, how this mechanism will work. The first thing that comes to my mind, my first concern is administration because when we pay VAT, it goes to a pool. The second step is identifying where those products came from. So, after identifying where those products came from, we also need to have some instructions on remitting or giving rebates to that local government. So, my fear is the administration portion of giving rebates—in a way, it is a rebate to the local government. So, that is my top-of-mind reaction to that proposal. Although I see the wisdom and I see the intention of the measure—I believe the intention is quite good because it is going to reward and also encourage participation from the local government—the\n",
      "96\n",
      "administration portion is something that I need to consult the BIR, whether that is administratively easy, administratively possible, and will not cost so much in terms of reallocating the rebates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Tolentino. Mr. President, I understand the initial administrative difficulty being espoused by the sponsor, but my proposal is that all the funds that would accrue to the local government units need not be pooled in one pool. Because, again, let me clarify, if I am a tourist and I exit an airport in Iligan City, for instance—Where is the airport in Iligan City? Cagayan de Oro.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Laguindingan Airport.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Tolentino. Laguindingan Airport. And the product that I purchased would refer to the famous peanuts of Iligan. Hindi na siguro dapat isali iyong sa mga produkto ng sapatos ng Marikina o roon sa mga Barong Tagalog na gawa sa Laguna. Doon pa lamang sa Iligan, sa Cagayan de Oro, ay dapat ma-withhold na at source iyong appropriate amount that should be given to the LGU concerned, because the more we pool this together and aggregate the amounts centrally, the more difficult administratively we will be dividing the amount. And we will be exposed to the administrative error of providing an amount to an LGU that is not a participant in the making of that product. Baka makakuha pa iyong ibang LGU na walang participation, Mr. President.\n",

      "Senator Gatchalian. That is a very good point made by our Senate President Pro Tempore because you might have a scenario wherein you buy luxury goods in Makati, but it is not necessarily produced in Makati because we all know that is the shopping district of the country. But then, again, Makati will gain some form of rebate. So, now the distinguishing...\n",

      "Senator Gatchalian. That is not the intention of the proposal because the intention is to promote local manufactured goods, promote local manufacturers.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we now have to segregate what will be part of that, what goods will be eligible for the rebate and what goods will not be illegible. So, off top, the administrative portion should be studied the I will consult the BIR on the administration portion, Mr. President, because that is a I am thinking that there will be a lot of steps in order to reach that goal, Mr. President, although, it is a very good concept, Mr. President, I see the point of the good gentleman from Tagaytay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Tolentino. If I may produce a realistic scenario. If you exit Thailand airport in Bangkok, you will be confronted with several local products like oils, ointments, even the dried Sampaloc placed in plastic bags. These are local products; these are not branded products, Mr. President. And you can claim a refund.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Tolentino. So, the delineation between a branded product—ano ba ang pangalan, mahirap i-pronounce iyong airport sa Bangkok—purchased in that airport, can be easily ascertained. Alam naman natin iyong local, in the same manner as when you buy that Iligan peanuts, you can differentiate that from a Lacoste or what item is available in the airport.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Tolentino. So, is the gentleman agreeable that perhaps a simplified mechanism involving local products that would benefit local government units in terms of a withheld amount coming from the supposed\n",
      "99\n",
      "100% would be beneficial to the local community as well, and to have a mechanism for this in his laudable measure doable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Gatchalian. I am thinking of a scenario where taking off from what our Senate President Pro temporary mentioned. For example, I am in Makati and I am a tourist and normally tourists, they shop in Makati, and you go to a shopping mall, for example, high-end brands, you buy them, you buy those items, you are eligible for refund. Now, if we are only distinguishing local products and, for example, you are a tourist, you go to a local store in Makati, so, now you have a step to distinguish which products are eligible, which products are not eligible. And then after that, we also need to track down those products are bought in Makati and, therefore, the rebate will go to Makati. So, off top, like the concept is good, it is just the administration portion we need to think about because we are encouraging the tourists to have a seamless, convenient experience from buying to the refund and if there will be steps in between, it might defeat the purpose of giving them the seamless, convenient refund experience. But I am open to studying that, I will consult the BIR on that particular concept if that is feasible and administratively possible, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Tolentino. Thank you, Mr. President. I think, to make it clear, there would be no dichotomy between a branded product and a local product, it is just the question of where if it is a local product, the share should proceed, the share should go. So, if it is your Iligan peanuts sold at NAIA, the best scenario for that is that Iligan City and the manufacturers of Iligan City should\n",
      "100\n",
      "benefit. It is not the place, the situs of the sale, but the situs of where the product emanated from. Iyon po ang dapat tulungan. Iyong Marikina, pag-ibinenta mo iyong sapatos sa NAIA, dapat kung mayroon mawi-withhold, ang mag-benefit din ay iyong Marikina shoe industry, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      " Senator Gatchalian.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. But, Mr. President, there will be also another scenario, for example, iyong Iligan peanuts. I believe the gentleman is referring to Cheding. Those were the favorite peanuts of Senator Ejercito whose owner, I think, is also here.\n",

      "\n",
      "But it is bought here and the receipt is Pasay or Makati. So, the only document that will be the basis for the rebate will be the receipt because the receipt will contain the seller or the merchant, Mr. President.

I think, Mr. President, there will come a time when the service provider, the third party, would be able to really have a threshold marking, place of—It is not your usual kakanin because we are talking here of products that can be easily transported abroad. Some airlines probably would not allow the usual travel in a Tupperware of his favorite kare-kare or dinuguan. That will not be allowed. We are not talking here about food products with international transport quality, not easily spoiled. Iyon talagang mata-travel, magagamit, madadala sa eroplano.\n",

      "\n",
      "These are usually placed in sealed plastic bags, sealed tightly, air-tight packed.\n",

      "The President Pro Tempore. So, we cannot distinguish who the manufacturer is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Tolentino. There would be proper markings, Mr. President. If we are referring to food products made in Cebu, usually the lechon is frozen and placed in a compact, air-tight receptacle. So, these are not the usual ready-to-eat food items. Just thinking out loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "But just the same, Mr. President, if there is a window to enable the LGUs hosting the manufacturing firms, to get a slight share of the amount to be refunded to enable them to really encourage more local manufacturers and local\n",
      "102\n",
      "tourism as well, I think that would be good. I think the good sponsor is amenable to that. I just do not know how it will be packaged and repackaged.\n",
      "\n",
      " Senator Gatchalian.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President, my initial thoughts on this will be the administration portion. How to execute it, taking into consideration the convenience and seamless experience of the tourist? We all travel and we all shop when we travel. A lot of us, including myself, actually avail of the VAT refund in different areas. And for me, one of the most convenient VAT refund experiences that I have encountered is in Singapore and also Korea. Actually, for that matter, once we buy, we give our passport, and all the merchandise that we bought will be sent to a database. And, when we go to the airport, show your passport or scan your passport. Everything will be there. All the merchandises that you bought will be there and the computation is so easy, and you can have an option of getting cash or getting credit card refund. But the point there is that everything is seamless and you do not have to worry about showing so many paperworks or showing so many receipts, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, going by that experience, that is also the vision on how we will implement it here later on, if this law gets approved, and I just need to study carefully and consult with the BIR and the DOF on the administrative side. The concept is good and noble; it is just the administrative portion that we need to study very carefully.\n",

      "Just to give a background, the main purpose of this measure is that the Universal Health Care Act was envisioned to give genuine access to quality healthcare for all Filipinos without the financial burden. However, as I mentioned last session, the data was based on the prevailing situation and circumstances when we were drafting the UHC. And at that time, our economy was good, but pandemic happened and nobody foresaw that. That is the reason why we filed the amendment to the UHC to adjust the premium rate contribution to give our direct contributors, the employees, the chance to recover from the pandemic.\n",

The reason why I also pushed for this is—a lot of our colleagues here are former local officials: the Presiding Officer, our Majority Leader—we know for a fact that kapag mayroon pong nagkasakit sa ating constituents, for example, cancer, dina-dialysis, especially the complicated diseases, iyon pong ipon nila ay talagang nauubos. That is the reason why we pushed for this so that it can somehow lighten the load or the burden of each Filipino family, Mr. President. Admittedly, it is an ambitious measure trying to cover all Filipinos, but I think we can do it. We will be entering the fifth year of implementation. It is a work in progress. It is a 10-year program. I would say that we are still far from the full implementation, but we are getting there, Mr. President.\n",

      "Senator Ejercito. Yes, because it was passed in 2019. We started with the 3% and, progressively, it went up to 5%. But, as I mentioned earlier, because of the pandemic, we have to make the necessary adjustments and—\n",

      "Senator Pimentel. Para klaro, ang direct contributor kaya tinawag na direct contributor, iyon kasi galing sa bulsa niya. Hindi ba?\n",

Under the Universal Health Care Law, to give the gentleman an example, for 2024, since it is already 5%, our percentage is already 5%, multiply it by 10,000, which is the income floor times 12, we will come up with P6,000 a year. Magiging P6,000, supposedly, iyan po ang nasa law. But the DBM only recommends about P3,000 for indigents and P5,000 for senior citizens, and it depends on the availability of funds. That is why hindi po maibigay iyong P6,000, that is the ideal, under the UHC Law. What the DBM only allots is about P3,000 for indigents and P5,000 for the senior citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Pimentel. All right, I get it, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",

Puwede naman nating sabihin, on paper, P6,000 each and yet we will just allocate P3,000 per head. Puwede namang ganoon.\n",

      "Bakit kaya iniba pa po ang treatment, Mr. President?\n",

Kasama rin sa emyenda sa section na ito ang pagbibigay sa PhilHealth ng kapangyarihang matapos makipagkonsulta sa mga miyembro nito at matapos irekomenda ng Secretary of Health na mag-adjust ng income floor at ceiling ayon sa kailangang-kailangan na pondo para sa benefit packages.\n",

Ang kanilang kontribusyon sa PhilHealth ay base sa income floor at kalahati ng kanilang kontribusyon ay sasagutin ng pamahalaan. Higit sa lahat, hindi dapat singilin ang kanilang unpaid premiums pagdating nila sa bansa.

      "Bilang tagapangulo ng Komite ng Public Information and Mass Media, narito ang aking mga katanungan:\n",
      "122\n",
      "Una, aware po ba ang ating magaling na senador sa PhilHealth survey on Universal Health Care? Ito ay pag-aaral na ginawa noong 2020 para, higit sa lahat, ay malaman ang antas ng kamalayan o level of awareness ng mga Pilipino tungkol sa Universal Health Care. Ang sabi po sa nasabing survey, only 15.65% of the respondents said that they knew what Universal Health Care meant—15.65% lamang ng mga na-survey ang nakakaalam kung ano ang ibig sabihin ng UHC. Nakalulungkot po ito—labing limang porsyento lamang. Awareness level was highest in Visayas. Sa Visayas po, 21% and significantly lower po ito sa Mindanao—12.78% lamang. Mas mataas ang awareness level tungkol sa Universal Healthcare sa Visayas at pinakamababa po sa Mindanao. Kung ganito po ang resulta ng survey noong 2020, masasabi po ba na naiintindihan ng ating mga kababayan ang kanilang entitlements sa ilalim ng UHC? Naiintindihan po ba nila ang batas? Masasabi din po ba natin na nagkaroon ng sapat na information campaign ang PhilHealth para ipaalam at ipaintindi sa mga tao ang Universal Healthcare lalo na ang benepisyong hatid nito para sa tao.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iyon po ang unang tanong. Pasensya na po at napakahaba.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Ejercito. Unang-una, maraming salamat sa inyong katanungan. Pero, tama po kayo, ang UHC ay isang napakagandang batas. We consider this as a landmark legislation. Marahil, isa ito sa mga batas na makatutulong sa karamihan ng ating mga kababayan. Ang nakalulungkot lamang po talaga rito ay marami sa ating mga kababayan ay hindi po naiintindihan at marami po ang hindi po alam na sila po ay makikinabang at magbebenepisyo na dito sa batas na ito. Tama po ang ginoo na medyo nagkulang po talaga ang ahensya ng ating\n",
      "123\n",
      "pamahalaan. Siguro ang Public Information Agency (PIA), PCOO noon, at siguro PhilHealth na rin sa pag-disseminate ng information sa pagpaalam sa publiko kung ano na po ang kanilang mga benepisyo sa programang ito. Siguro, kung babanggitin ko lamang po ang ilang mga benefit package ay talagang nag-level up na rin po. Halimbawa po, mayroon kayong Leukemia, makakakuha kayo ng P500,000; breast cancer, aabot po hanggang P1.4 million; prostate cancer, P100,000; colon cancer, from P150,000 to P300,000; kidney transplant, P600,000; at doon sa mga open heart surgery po, aabot po ng hanggang P500,000. So, ang hindi po alam ng ating mga kababayan, lahat po ng Pilipino, basta Pilipino ka, automatic miyembro ka na ng PhilHealth at ito na po iyong mga benefit package na inyong puwedeng ma-avail. So, medyo kulang pa talaga sa information campaign ang ating mga ahensya ng gobyerno at lalo na sa nabanggit ng ginoo kanina, iyong ating mga OFW na sila po ang nag-react noong panahon ng pandemya. Bakit daw sinisingil sila na mayroon pang increase sa kanilang contribution gayong hindi sila nakikinabang. Ang hindi po naipaliwanag ng atin pong mga ahensya na ang kanilang pamilya ay covered din po ng Universal Healthcare Law. Kahit po sila ay nasa ibang bansa, hindi na nila poproblemahin ang kanilang mga naiwan na mga kamag-anak dahil ang gobyerno ay nandiyan na para umalalay sa kanila sa oras ng kanilang pangangailangan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Padilla. Opo. Mayroon lamang pong tanong. May phone in question. Sabi nga po nila, ibig daw po bang sabihin nito na kapag sila pa ay\n",
      "124\n",
      "nandirito sa UHC, wala na po silang babayaran? Kapag mayroon na silang premier, wala na po ba? Masisiguro po ba raw na wala na silang babayaran?\n",
      "\n",
      " Senator Ejercito.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depende po iyan. Ang target po natin kasi ay maibaba ang tinatawag na “out of pocket expense”. Noong nagsimula po tayo bago maipasa ang Universal Healthcare Law, siguro almost 70% ang out of pocket expense. Ibig-sabihin po niyan, lagpas kalahati ay binabayaran po nila, iyong medical expenses sa pamilya. Nakahihingi ng assistance sa PCSO, sa PAGCOR, sa mga opisyal at iba pang ahensiya pero lagpas kalahati po ay nanggagaling sa sariling bulsa. With the passage of the UHC Law in 2019 hanggang ngayon, iyan po ay naibaba, nasa mga 40% na lamang iyong out-of-pocket expense. Mahaba-haba pa iyong ating tatahakin dahil we are only going on our fifth year of implementation. Ten-year program po kasi ito. Ang target natin, kung maibaba natin ng 30%, maganda po sana.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pero, ngayon po, ang target natin ay marami sa mga indigent ay tinatawag na “zero balance billing” na dapat. Kapag ikaw ay mahirap, dapat kapag ikaw ay naospital, lalo na sa mga government hospital na accredited ng PhilHealth, ang target natin ay zero balance billing, iyong wala na po kayong dapat bayaran. May ilang probinsiya na talagang fully implemented na, na nakararanas na sila ng zero balance billing.\n",
      "\n",
      " Senator Padilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "Napakaganda po niyon, Mr. President. Bale, ang target po talaga ay wala ng babayaran? Sa ibang mga lugar po, wala ng binabayaran?\n",
      "\n",
      " Senator Ejercito.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basta iyong basic services po dapat ay wala na silang babayaran.\n",
      "125\n",
      "Dalawang bagay po ang mahalaga sa UHC. Unang-una ay hindi malubog sa kahirapan ang nagpapagamot. Iyon ang ating intensiyon at gagaling ang may sakit. Kaya ang sabi nga nila, we want to give access to genuine health care for all Filipinos without the financial burden. Kumbaga, lahat sana ay mapagaling at matulungan ng ating pamahalaan, maalalayan at hindi na po sila mabigatan.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, mahalaga rin talaga sana iyong kaalaman. Iyon lamang ang problema, talagang medyo nagkulang tayo. Hopefully, this time, ang sabi naman ng PhilHealth, ng PIA, at ng iba pang sangay ng gobyerno, kinakailangang magkaroon ng information dissemination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sa katunayan, nanggaling po ako ng Korea at Singapore nung isang taon, kung saan may concentration ang OFWs natin. Noong naipaliwanag po natin sa kanila iyong benepisyo, lalong-lalo na sa pamilya ay natuwa po sila. Dagdagan ko na lamang po with regard to our OFW. Dahil po sa ating pagbigay ng kahalagahan sa kanilang contribution sa ating ekonomiya, nabanggit ng butihing senador na isa-subsidize pa nga natin ng 50%, iyong kanilang premium contribution ay isa-subsidize na natin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Padilla. Maliwanag po pagdating doon sa mga nag-contribute. Mayroon lang po uling isang tanong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alam po ninyo, sa Estados Unidos, noong panahon ni Presidente Obama, mayroong Obama Care. Iyong Obama Care, pati raw po iyong mga walang insurance na hinuhulugan ay binigyan ng health care. Ito raw po bang UHC ay parang ganoon din? Pati raw po ba iyong mga walang contribution ay makakabenepisyo?\n",
      "126\n",
      "Senator Ejercito. Parang ganoon na rin po, covered na lahat. Dati po, iyong direct contributors lamang at ang kanilang pamilya ang nakikinabang. Pero, under the Universal Health Care Act, isinama na rin po natin iyong direct, indirect contributors na tinatawag—iyan po ang indigents, ang senior citizens, at ang PWDs—Iyong mga walang kapasidad na magbayad ng premium contribution, sila ay isinama na rin. Pero, sa halip na sila po ay pumila—kasi nakikita natin noon, pumipila sila nang napakahaba at nabibilad sa PCSO, PAGCOR, at iba pang mga ahensiya—iyon pong pondo for social contribution ng PAGCOR at PCSO, ilinagay na rin natin sa Universal Health Care Fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, iyon po ang dahilan kung bakit kinuha na natin para mawala na dapat iyong pila. Kaya kasama po ang indigents. Parang Obama Care pero ang lamang po kasi sa Estados Unideos ay marami silang ahensiya. Tayo po ay iisa lamang, ang PhilHealth lamang ang ating national health insurance. Kaya nga hindi po puwedeng pumalpak ang PhilHealth dahil nag-iisa lamang po ang ahensiya na inaasahan sa implementasyon ng Universal Health Care Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Padilla. Mahal na Pangulo, bale wala pong pinipili rito sa UHC, may kontribusyon o wala?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Ejercito. Wala po, basta ikaw ay Filipino, automatic ikaw ay miyembro at covered ng PhilHealth. Kung baga, dapat maramdaman ng—bagaman at malayo pa tayo na iyong 100% coverage ay kahit papaano makagaan tayo. Sa ngayon ay 40%, kung maibaba natin later on to 30% iyong nanggagaling sa bulsa or iyong out of pocket expense ay malaking bagay na po iyon.\n",
      "127\n",
      "So, ang pakay po natin talaga ay mapagaan iyong gastusin, iyong pinapasan sa araw-araw na pamumuhay ng bawat Pilipino.\n",

      " Senator Padilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opo. mayroon po raw inaprubahang pondo para sa survey ng Universal Healthcare noong 2023. Lumabas na ba iyong resulta nitong survey na ito?\n",

Kasi sa ngayon po, nakalulungkot iyong mga figure na iyan, na kahit anong ganda ng ating iniisip para sa ating mga kababayan, nag-contribute man o hindi, pero papaano kaya ito kung kakaunti lamang po ang nakaaalam?

At kanila na pong tinaasan din iyong kanilang budget para mas mapalawig iyong kanilang information and educational campaign—medyo huli na po, sana noong umpisa pa. Pero ngayon po ay tinaasan na nila iyong budget.\n",

      "Senator Padilla. Maraming salamat po.\n",
      "\n",
      "G. Pangulo, napakahalaga po ng public information. Sa katunayan, ito po ay nasa Konstitusyon natin. Hinihingi po natin na sana sa ating mga ahensiya sa gobyerno na kapag mayroong pumapasang batas ay bibigyan po nila ng tamang atensiyon ang public information. Dahil hangga’t walang public information ay parang wala rin po tayong ginawang batas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Ejercito. Tama po. Sa katunayan, iyon pong PhilHealth, hindi lamang natin sinasagot iyong mga naoospital. In fact, one of the salient features is to strengthen the preventive side kasama nga po iyong libreng check-up, laboratory test through the Konsulta Caravan. Nagko-Konsulta Caravan na po sila.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ngayon po, sa tulong po ng mga LGU—ang ULAP, ang League of Provinces, ang League of Municipalities, League of Cities—at sabi nga rin ng PhilHealth at DOH, sa tulong ninyo raw po bilang chairperson ng Committee on Public Information and Mass Media, lalo na kayo ay sikat, ay malaki ang maitutulong.\n",

      "Senator Ejercito. Tama naman po, Mr. President. Pero bago naman po natin ipinasa ito, before we passed this measure, we had a technical working group [meeting]. We made sure that PhilHealth would be financially healthy so that even if there would be losses that would be incurred because of the adjustments, we made sure that they could afford. As a matter of fact, ang sabi nga, naging controversial nga po iyong pondo, iyong excess or reserved fund. With that amount, I think we can prioritize our members who are all Filipinos by increasing the benefits, first and foremost, and if we can lower the premium contribution through legislation with what we are doing right now so that it will not burden our members who are all Filipinos. Bago natin siguro ideklara na may excess funds, we make sure first that the benefits to all members, to all Filipinos, will be given and delivered.\n",

      "Well, although hindi natin naiintindihan lahat kaagad iyan, pero the point is, iyong system nila, they have thought of the different\n",

      "combinations na possibility—who is the Filipino availing of the coverage. Iba-\n",
      "\n",
      "ibang mga situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, magkano po—punta na tayo sa effect ng inyong inflows. Ano po ang effect sa inflow ninyo nitong tatlo? Correct me, if I am wrong, Mr. President, nakikita ko tatlo ang ating amendments natin dito: premium rate, 5%, baba natin sa 4%; income ceiling, P100,000, binaba ninyo sa P50,000; and ang OFWs na binibigyan ninyo ngayon ng 50% discount. Ano ang epekto po nito? Iyong tatlong combinations lang po na iyon, are these billions of pesos?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Ejercito. Mr. President, at present, under the UHC law at 5%, the projected inflow is P202 billion with P100,000 ceiling. If we adjust it to 4%, it will now become P147 billion, with P50,000. The difference po will be P55 billion, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Pimentel. For the direct contributors, tama?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Ejercito. Yes, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Pimentel. Now, for the migrant workers assuming—i-assume lamang natin na 170,000, hindi tayo naka-attract na magdagdag, magbayad. So, let us say, iyong 170,000 pa rin ang nagbabayad, magkano po ang decrease sa ating inflow kasi may 50% discount po tayong ibibigay?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Ejercito. Mr. President, there will be no difference considering that the half, which is iyong 50%, will be subsidized by the government. So, babayaran pa rin po iyon. So, it will still be the same. And I think I, as I mentioned earlier, I think they project that it will increase because of the lower rates and, at the same time, the benefit packages.\n",
      "138\n",
      "Senator Pimentel. So how about the subsidy now of the government?\n",
      "\n",
      "How will our amendments affect the subsidy of the government? Iyong ngayon, sabi niyo the government now, the DBM uses the two figures: P3,000 pesos for indigents; and P5,000 pesos for senior citizens. Because of the new rate, will anything change in the national subsidy expected from the national government?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Ejercito. At present, the OFW is paying P6,000. If ever we pass this amendment, then the government will subsidize 50%—that will be P3,000. So that means that it will be the same as the rate of the indigent, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Pimentel. So, meaning to say, kahit ipasa natin ito, iyong formula ng DBM to determine the national subsidy for the premium contributions of the indirect contributors should not be affected. Iyon ba ang gusto ninyong sabihin? Puwede pa rin nilang ituloy na P3,000 per indigent; P5,000 per senior citizen; and P3,000 per OFW. Ganoon ang pag-compute nila? Wala pong pagbabago?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Ejercito. Mr. President, because DBM bases their computation on availability of funds, but if there are funds available, then they should be following what the income floor and what is to be laid in the law, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Pimentel. Why is the DOF sweeping the money of the PhilHealth? Because there are no available funds, hindi ba? Ganoon po ba?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Ejercito. Mr. President…\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Pimentel. Hindi, punta na po tayo roon, ano naman rhetorical question naman iyon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Ejercito. Well, Mr. President, it is a—well, probably, that has been discussed already in the past hearing that their legal basis is because of\n",
      "139\n",
      "The General Appropriations Act of 2024\n",
      "\n",
      " Special Provision on Unprogrammed Appropriations\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Pimentel. Hindi nga, sabi ninyo the DBM will give PhilHealth funds depending on the availability of funds. Now, the DOF is sweeping up the funds of PhilHealth because of lack of funds. So, anong nangyari ngayon? So, we are not expecting any subsidy from the national government because the national government is even looking at PhilHealth to get funds? Paano po iyon? Parang paradoxical situation, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Ejercito. For this year, the subsidy of PhilHealth is about P61 billion. And for next year, what is recommended in the NEP is about P75 billion subsidy, Mr. President. Kahit papaano, tumaas pa rin now, pero I think what has been discussed is iyong controversial reserve and excess funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, I, personally, Mr. President, before we declare that there is an excess or reserve fund, we have to first cater to the benefit of the members, who are all Filipinos. Itaas po natin ang benefit packages—improve the benefit packages, make sure that there are no more claimants—kapag nawala na ho iyong mga pumipila para humingi ng tulong, and, last but not the least, as what we are doing right now, we are trying to adjust the premium contribution—to lower it—so that it will, at least, ease the burden of the ordinary member.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, sa akin po, siguro, personally, iyon po, if all of these things have been satisfied, then that is the only time that PhilHealth can declare that there really is a reserve fund, Mr. President.\n",
      "\n",
      "138\n",
      "140\n",
      "Senator Pimentel. May we know from the PhilHealth representatives how much is the reserve fund that we are talking about? The amount is P89.9 billion, pero i-round off na lamang natin, for purposes of discussion, to P90 billion. That is the reserve fund. How much is that reserved fund, and is that in actual cash?\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Ejercito. We are just trying to retrieve the DOF contribution. Magkaiba po kasi talaga. Madalas iyong computation, the DOF uses the actual. Kaya po minsan ay lumalaki po iyong sa PhilHealth because it is based on actuarial projections, Mr. President. But we are trying to retrieve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Pimentel. Kunyari, as of today, magkano po ang reserve fund—nabawasan na iyan ng P20 billion iyan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Ejercito. As of 2023, Mr. President, PhilHealth’s reserve fund is P463.7 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senator Pimentel. So, iyon po iyon? I mean, iyan po ang balak kunan ng P90 billion, tama po, Mr. President? Tama po ba? I-establish muna natin iyong facts. Iyong P463 billion fund—we can call that excess fund or reserve fund, diyan po ba balak kunin ng DOF iyong P90 billion.\n",

Iyon pong sa DOF, the DOF number is P280.6 billion. The Minority Leader will probably ask why is thera a big difference because DOF bases it on the actual computation while PhilHealth basis it on actuarial projection. Kaya po mas mataas talaga. Iyong P463.7 billion is based on actuarial projection while iyong sa DOF po, iyong P280.6 billion, is based on the actual expenditure, Mr. President.\n",
